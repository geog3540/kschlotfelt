              </h4>
              <p class="card-text"> This was the first map we made on Observable and the most coding I had done in over 4 years. As far as patterns go, we can see that there isn't a huge hispanic population across Minnesota. I had expected that the two counties with St. Paul and Minneapolis (Ramsey and Hennepin) to have a higher percent of hispanic population, only becuase those have, in general, a higher total population. Yet, they're in the middle between 3% and 15%. In the last assignment when I saw that there were two counties that really stand out, I assumed that they would be the Twin Cities. We do see that there tends to be a higher percentage of hispanic further south - there appears to be fewer in the most of the northern counties. This makes a certain amount of sense since northern Minnesota is not as populated. So, we can see that general population pattern on this map. </p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">Below is the map of the number of bachelor's and graduate degrees in 2015 in the state of Washington. I had to look at another map of the state to see where the larger cities are and they - not surprisingly - line up to our darker purple and pink circles below. The giant cluster on the far west is where the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area is located. We also see another big cluster in the southwest where Portland is just across the state boarder and in the east there is Spokane. This makes perfect sense that when we have a larger population we will have a higher number of census tracts. For that reason, we can't really tell on this map what the size of some of these tracts are in the metropolitan areas since there is overlap of classification symbols. This makes it difficult to interprete some of the smaller circles scattered throughout the areas. We could assume that they may be lower-income as well as lower-educated tracts. Or perhaps that is not a tract where more higher educated people want to live, because they are further away from their jobs. Or there could be a whole list of unknown variables that are affecting these tracts with fewer people with higher degrees.

So, while we may not be able to fully understand or see the smaller variables within the data on this map, we can see the general pattern that more people with higher degrees tend to live in areas with a higher population and more job opportunities.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text"> The third map we created for this class was a bivariate map. A biavatriate or multivariate map takes multiple variables and displays them on one map using a set of thematic symbols. So, in this case, combining two choropleth maps. I used some of the same data from the last map, but a more recent year, and combined it with levels of poverty. I was wondering if there were areas where we had highly educated people living below the poverty line. The darkest purple indicates just that and there are a few census tracts that have that color. In general, we can see a pattern of more rural areas having lower poverty and fewer higher degrees of education, while more populated areas have more inherent variety.</p>

              <p class="card-text">This semester we didn't actually have to make an isarithmic map, so here is Dr. Caglar's as an example. An isarithmic map is a thematic map that displays qualitative, continuious data. So, something like air quality or weather or elevation can be used in an isarithmic display. These kinds of maps also usually utilize some sort of interpolation, such as krieg, IDW, or spline, etc. Each method has their pros and cons in how they interprete the given data to estimate the unknown points.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This link shows you four choropleth maps, each one displaying a different variable. If you hover over one county, it shows the same county's data in each map - very handy for comparisonI wanted to expand further upon my third map (higher education percentages in Washington) This time I examined it on the county level since census tracts were too difficult to read. In these maps you can see the patterns of poverty, higher education, and a break down of how poverty among those who have a higher degree and thier sex. As to be expected, we see the majority of the darker colors (indicating higher percentages) are in the counties witht he higher populations - except for the male poverty, which was already lower than the female levels. I found it interesting that one county that stuck out to me was Whitman on the Eastern side of the state. They were higher for all three poverty variables, and they had a lower percentage of higher degrees. You normally assume that would be the case, where there is higher education you would think that more people would be paid a living wage, so it would makes sense that a county with lower education levels would have higher poverty.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">his was a final group project. We decided to take a deeper look into the history of the Mormon Trail - which was at the same time as the Oregon and California trails in the mid-1800s. We plotted the latitude and longitude points on our map and when you hover over each point a box would pop up to give you more information about that area along the trail. The biggest challenge of this project was to sift through all the archaeological and historical data that we had collected. Our original plan was to have it be focused on archaeological points along the trail in Iowa, however, many of the sources we had were almost 100 pages of archaological sites and objects listed. It was overwhelming, so we ended up looking at the various trails through Iowa and the history of the overall trail.</p>
